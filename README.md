# Minecraft server for dummies

(Very) Easily install a minecraft server directly on your machine or inside a Docker container

# Requirement (Docker part): 
 - Docker Engine 17.09+
 - Docker-compose 1.18.0+ (PATH include)
 
# CircleCI implications :
All versions of the game server are compiled and available on Docker Hub.
For the moment, the clone repo way is not straightforward, i will make this work again in a few time.


# How to make it run:
- Clone the repo (No, really?)
- Store your save folder in "files/your-save-folder-inside-me/" (If you got one)
- Check which minecraft version you want to play at [the Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Version_history)
- Run setup-wizard.sh as root
- Follow the instructions 
- Play!
